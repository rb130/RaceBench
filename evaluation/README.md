# Fuzzer Evalutation

## Add a new fuzzer

Create new folder in `fuzzers` with fuzzer's name.

Write the these scripts in fuzzer's folder:
- `compile_env.sh`: set up fuzzer compiler environment, such as `CC` and `CXX`.
- `fuzz.sh`: start fuzzing. The first two arguments are input and output directory. Following arguments are target's command line, where input file name is denoted by `{input_file}`.
- `list_trigger.sh` (optional): list buggy inputs. The first argument is fuzzer's output directory.

List fuzzer's name in `fuzzers/list.txt`, one name per line.

## Add a new target

Put the target generated by `RaceBench/main.py` into the `programs` folder.

List target's name in `programs/list.txt`, one name per line.

## Run fuzzers

```sh
python3 fuzz-all.py cores timeout
```

`RaceBench/stat_view.py` demonstrates how to check the results.
